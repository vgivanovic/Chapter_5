% \medskip\item[term] Description...

\medskip\item[ADA] Average Daily Attendance, the method that the state of California uses to determine how many students are in a particular school. An alternative is to use the number of students enrolled, some of whom may attend sporadically but still need to be educated when they do attend.

\medskip\item[arm's length transaction] A transaction, usually financial, where all parties are independent and self-interested.

\medskip\item[basic aid] See ``community funded'', the preferred term.
  
\medskip\item[blended learning] A method of teaching where both in-person instruction and virtual instruction are used.

\medskip\item[bond] A bond is a loan whose terms (maturity date, interest rate) are fixed. Bonds are issued by a borrower (the debtor) to investors (the creditors) who are the source of the funds borrowed. The borrower is liable for repaying the debt,  usually on a fixed schedule. In return for getting the funds now, the borrower agrees to compensate the creditor by repaying both the amount loaned (the principal) and interest on the amount outstanding at an agreed upon (ther interest) rate.

For example, a school district (the borrower and debtor) might issue a bond that is bought by one or more investors (the creditors) and use those funds to build a school. The school district must then repay the bond, usually in equal monthly payments, that pay back the principal and any interest to the  purchasers of the bond.

\medskip\item[charter school] A quasi-private school that is publicly funded but privately run.

\medskip\item[chartering authority] A governmental entity that grants charter schools the authority to operate and which provides oversight. In California, a chartering authority could be a public school district, a county office of education, or the California Department of Education.

\medskip\item[charter management organization (CMO)] ``A non-profit organization that operates or manages a network of charter schools (either through a contract or as the charter holder) linked by centralized support, operations, and oversight \parencite{CDE2023}''.

\medskip\item[charter school chain] One or more individual charter schools owned by or operated by a parent organization, i.e.  a charter management organization or a education management organization.

\medskip\item[community funded] In California, if the local property tax revenue of a public school district exceeds the state minimum educational guarantee under Prop. 98, that district is called ``community funded'' (formerly ``basic aid'').

\medskip\item[conduit bond] A conduit bond is a type of municipal bond where the bond is paid back, not by a public entity's reveue stream, but by a private entity, for example, a limited liability company or corporation. The public entity is merely the conduit, a passthrough entity, between investors and a private entity. (See \textcite{GASB91_2019} for details on what qualifies as a conduit bond.) %chktex 8

the the source of the funds borrowed is not an investor, but merely a passthrough between the source of the funds and the borrower. For example, a state authority might buy a bond from a school district and pay the school district with taxpayer funds. The issuer of the bonds (the school district) then owes the state authority the bond principal plus interest.

\medskip\item[education management organization (EMO)] ``A for-profit entity that operates or manages a network of charter schools (either through a contract or as the charter holder) linked by centralized support, operations, and oversight.''\parencite{CDE2021b} %chktex 38

\medskip\item[municipal bond] A municipal bond is a bond issued by a public entity and bought by investors. The public entity (the debtor) borrows from investors (the creditor). Investors loan money to the public entity, and the public entity pays the investors back over time with interest. The public entity (usually) uses its revenue stream (i.e. taxes paid) to pay back the principal and interest.

\medskip\item[student pushout] When charter schools push their lowest performing students out.

\medskip\item[tax-exempt conduit bonds] Bonds issued to make loans to entities other than state or local governments are known as
“conduit bonds” or “conduit issues” and state or local governments that issue these bonds are known as “conduit issuers.” Conduit issuers (usually) ensure that the revenues of the charter school are sufficient to pay off the conduit bond with interest.

\medskip\item[theory of action] A logical chain of reasoning that explains what needs to happen to go from a particular (current) social state to another (future) social state.
