\chapter{Discussion}\label{ch:discussion}\indent%

Recall this dissertation's research question (p.~\pageref{sec:research-question}):
\begin{quote}
  Has Rocketship structured itself to earn a return for its founders and investors, focusing especially on its real estate transactions?
\end{quote}
This question can be parsed into three sub-questions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Has Rocketship structured itself to make a profit?\footnote{Public benefit corporations (non-profits) are allowed to make a profit, i.e.\ revenue exceeds expenses; they are, however, not allowed to \textit{distribute} that profit. Any profit must be use to further is public benefit purpose identified in their articles of incorporation.}
  \item If so, is real estate the vehicle that Rocketship uses to make money?
  \item Is this Rocketship's intent?
\end{enumerate}

\index{key findings|(}%
After a careful examination of Rocketship's finances, it appears that Rocketship has, in fact, deliberately structured itself to make a profit using real estate as the means of generating that profit. However, a key finding is that the analysis of Rocketship's \textit{publicly available} financial documents show that any profits derived from operations of the schools appear to have been legally obtained and there is no evidence that these profits have been distributed to private persons, at least in California. But since some portion of these profits have been used to open non-profit charter schools in other states, no definitive finding can be made about the ultimate beneficiaries of these funds without further investigation. Some questionable expenditures were identified, namely \$7.5M spent on travel in 2019–2022. This is a large sum, and should also be investigated.%
\index{key findings|)}

The absence of evidence of illegal activity by Rocketship is fortunate because California is notorious for charter school fraud. In 2015, three advocacy organizations found \$81M in fraud \citeauthor{CPD2015.etal}. The report, \citetitle{CPD2015.etal} estimated in 2015 that, ``The vast majority of this fraud perpetuated by charter officials will go undetected because California lacks the oversight necessary to identify the fraud.'' \parencite[2]{CPD2015.etal}. A massive fraud was, fortunately, discovered in 2019: A single online charter school had defrauded the State of California of \$400M. With tens billions of dollars of funding for charter schools in California alone coupled with lax oversight, the temptation for fraud must be great. 

The next section presents an answer to this dissertation's research question. How that will be done is based on work done by Stephen Toulmin, a British philosopher interested in moral reasoning \parencite{Toulmin2003}. He developed in \citetitle{Toulmin2003} a method for making practical arguments where ethics and morality played a role. Toulmin arguments have been widely adopted. %chktex 12

\section{Answering the Research Question}\label{sec:answ-rese-quest}\indent
\subsection{A Toulmin-Style Argument}\label{sec:toulmin-arguments}%
\indent

\index{Toulmin-style arguments|(}
A Toulmin argument has six components:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Claims are the statements which must be justified.
  \item Grounds are the evidence (facts, data) that provide the basis for making the claim or drawing a conclusion.
  \item Warrants are the connection between the claim and the evidence which backs up the claim.
  \item Backings buttress warrants.
  \item Rebuttals are counter-arguments, made in advance, to potential objections.
  \item Qualifiers express the degree of certainty about the claim.
\end{enumerate}
Often only the first three components are articulated. \prettyref{fig:toulmin-arg} below diagrams the relationship between the parts of a Toulmin argument.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Claim}\label{p:claim}
This dissertation's claim is that Rocketship is structured and operates to leverage government funding (loans, grants, credit repair) to increase their real estate holdings which then allows Rocketship to open more charter schools. However, Rocketship doesn't appear to distribute any profits to private parties such as its founders or investors.

\paragraph{Grounds}
Supporting that claim is the observation that the main focus of Rocketship's leadership is not on academic success, but on acquiring real estate that is paid for by someone else. There are four reasons which make up the grounds that support the claim:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Rocketship is organized in a way that facilitates real estate transactions.
  \item Rocketship owns, except in one case (out of ten), their own facilities and has borrowed heavily to purchase those facilities.
  \item Rocketship's leaders spend their time on real estate, not on educational issues.
  \item California law, Rocketship's Articles of Incorporation, and IRS Code expressly forbid a non-profit from private enrichment.
\end{itemize}

Right from the beginning, Rocketship's founders separated the financing, acquisition, and operation of their facilities from the pedagogical side of running a school. The founders borrowed heavily and made extensive use of government programs to fund their real estate projects. Rocketship has not availed itself (except in one instance) of alternative ways of acquiring facilities. They have not used Proposition 39 to obtain classrooms and fields from a school's home district. They have not tried to convert commercial office space into classrooms. They have not modified existing buildings to serve as schools or classrooms. Instead they bought land and built schools.

Rocketship’s policy of owning its facilities has led it to accumulate over \$185M of debt as of 2022, which comes to roughly \$32K per child. If that debt costs 3\% yearly to service, that is another \$5.4M per year that is not going directly toward educating children. Rocketship could have rented facilities with the rent being three quarters covered by SB 740 funds. In fact, the State of California does cover three quarters of the rent, but that rent goes to pay off loans taken out to purchase property owned by Launchpad Development. 

This focus on real estate shows up in the topics that the Rocketship Board and subcommittees discuss in meetings. Overwhelmingly, Rocketship's leaders and administrators meet to discuss finance and real estate. For example, the 08 Sep 2009 meeting of the Board of Directors\footnote{That particular meeting was chosen as an example almost at random. It was actually chosen merely because it had the largest file size of any of the retrieved board packets.} discussed or took action on the following topics:
\begin{itemize}
  \item CEO Update
  \item COO Update: 5 Year Growth Plan, Monthly Dashboard, New School Monitoring
  \item New Board Responsibilities/Requirements, Committee Reporting Format \& Committee Membership
  \item Real Estate Site Selection \& School Greenlighting Process
  \item Launch Pad Incorporation \& Hiring of CEO
  \item Approval of Launch Pad Incorporation
  \item Approval of Executive Committee Ownership of Real Estate Site Selection
  \item Hiring of Launch Pad CEO
  \item Approval of Rocketship Education Board Expectations \& Empowerment of Executive Committee to evaluate other board members
  \item Approval of Rocketship 3 Los Suenos Site Selection
\end{itemize}
Not a single one of these topics concerns academics or pedagogy. Further, of the four board subcommittees, three (Business, Executive, Development) are focused on something other than student success. The one that is not is the Achievement Committee.

Since Rocketship Education and Launchpad Development, according to California law and IRS regulations, as non-profit public benefit corporations, cannot distribute their income or assets to individuals or for profit entities according to California law and to their Articles of Incorporation, Rocketship's leadership  must have had a different goal than enriching individuals. Rocketship Education's and Launchpad Development Company's Articles of Incorporation both contain language that is similar to, but more clearly expressed by ``Summit Public School's [Restated] Articles of Incorporation'':
\begin{quotation}
  Article III: The property of this Corporation is \textit{irrevocably} [emphasis added] dedicated to charitable purposes and no part of the \textit{net income or assets} [emphasis added] thereof or to the benefit of private persons except that the Corporation shall be authorized and empowered to pay reasonable compensation for services rendered and to make payments and distributions in furtherance of the purposes set forth in Article II of these Articles of Incorporation. \parencite[2]{SummitPublicSchools2017}
\end{quotation}
The Articles of Incorporation for both Rocketship and Launchpad are likely equivalent to the first paragraph of Article III of Summit's Articles of Incorporation quoted above, but those passages are not as explicit or definitive, and they are spread out over several articles and paragraphs.\footnote{Since both Rocketship and Summit make an exception to the prohibition of private gain for services rendered in their articles of incorporation, and entirely reasonable exception, and Launchpad's articles of incorporation do not, this raises the question of whether the \$300+ salary of Launchpad's CFO \parencite[7]{2019LDC990} in 2019–2020, for example, violates Launchpad's Articles of Incorporation.} California law and IRS code forbid distribution of income or assets to anything but another public benefit corporation (see \prettyref{sec:real-estate-conv} below) with a similar public benefit focus. 

\paragraph{Backing}
Time and money are both in limited supply, so firms must decide how to allocate their time and money, and this allocation reveals a firm's true preferences and its goals.

\paragraph{Rebuttals}
A possible objection is that the grounds given are neither necessary nor sufficient to prove the claim made on p.~\pageref{p:claim}; there could be reasons other than expansionary reasons for Rocketship to have structured themselves they way they did. True, and also true, is that the way they spend their time and money could have been forced on them by circumstance or by law. Also true.

As a rebuttal to these objections, both overlook the element of choice that Rocketship's leaders had when structuring their organization. The founders knew what they were getting themselves into because their board of directors and founders had both extensive real estate experience and charter school startup experience. They chose an organization that made RSED the decision maker and Launchpad the accumulator of value. They also understood that California law and IRS regulations didn't allow private enrichment because that was stated in their Articles of Incorporation. And lastly, they chose the purview of each board subcommittee. In other words, they were intentional in their choices because they had alternatives.

Rocketship's leadership could have chosen to make RSED (the parent organization) a 509(a)(3) supporting charity for individual 503(c)(3) non-profit public benefit corporations (the schools) and only provide requested services instead of forced management. Another alternative is that they could have even done away with RSED completely and just had a loose collection of independent charter schools. 

Rocketship had the freedom to choose their organizational structure. That combined with their knowledge that private enrichment is not allowed for non-profits, plus operating a sweep and having three times as many committees concerned with money and real estate than on student outcomes strongly suggests that Rocketship knew exactly what needed to be done, and then did it.
\index{Toulmin-style arguments|)}

Two questions remain: How and Why? It is not known how the owners and investors of Rocketship might convert the assets of Rocketship and Launchpad into transferable wealth. Perhaps they do not intend to. \prettyref{tab:types_conversion} below lists some of the forms and restrictions on converting real estate assets owned by a non-profit charter school.

\index{conversion, types of|(}

  \end{tabulary}
\end{table}
\index{conversion, types of|)}

\index{non-profit!private gain|(}
That then begs the question of why Rocketship is accumulating assets. According to California law and to IRS Code, charter schools are not allowed to transfer money to a for-profit entity or to private individuals. The option which makes the most sense in explaining Rocketship's structure and activities given the investments of Reed Hastings, Andre Agassi, the Walton Family Foundation, and others, all strong charter school supporters, is that Rocketship wants to become a self-perpetuating pipeline of new charter schools for the entire United States. Their expansion into Washington, D.C., Texas, Tennessee, and Wisconsin exactly fits this conjecture.

But it is also possible that the billionaires identified above have promised the founders or directors of Rocketship a bonus if they successfully create a model for self-perpetuating charter schools. Detecting such a payout, in another state or country (Panama, Cayman Islands) is difficult and becomes increasingly difficult the longer the time lag between leaving Rocketship and receiving the payout. Tens of millions of dollars of bonus would not even rise to the level of a rounding error in the books of billionaires.
\index{non-profit!private gain|)}

\section{Public Policy Issues}%
\label{sec:publ-policy-chang}\indent%

\index{public policy issues|(}
There are at least three major public policy issues that are raised by Rocketship's growth in assets and presumed expansion goals. First, are charter schools or charter school chains a net benefit to Californians? Secondly, is there too much opportunity for fraud, and lastly, should charter school chains in California use their assets (paid for by Californians) to create charter schools in other states? This last public policy issue could be more broadly construed to ask if any Californian tax dollars should leave the state with no benefit to Californians.

The first of these public policy issues, the net benefit of Californian charter schools to California, is beyond the scope of this dissertation because it would require a thorough analysis of not only the finances of charter schools, but also of the costs and benefits of the education they offer, their impact on public schools, and their impact on the communities they serve. The second and third issues—opportunities for fraud and creating charter schools in other states—are discussed in the sections below.
\index{public policy issues|(}

\subsection{Fraud}%
\label{sec:fraud}\indent%

\index{public policy issues!fraud|(}
The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners issues an annual \textit{A Report to the Nations} which is a global study on occupational fraud. Of interest is a diagram of the types of occupational fraud, reproduced below.
\begin{figure}[htp]
  \caption{\textit{The Fraud Tree}}%
  \label{fig:fraud-tree}\centering%
  \copyrightbox[b] {\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{2022 Report to the Nations-p.10}}
  {Reproduced by permission with attribution: \textit{Occupational Fraud 2022: A Report to the Nations.} Copyright 2022 by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, Inc.}
\end{figure}
The reason the Fraud Tree is interesting is because public policy should make sure that laws or regulations are in place to prevent all types of fraud from occurring. The diagram shows three major categories, eight immediate subcategories, and 47 specific types of occupational fraud, fraud that occurs in the context of employment. Note that much of this fraud can be eliminated by mandating robust internal controls and thorough, independent audits, neither of which are completely in place for charter schools. This should be an active area for new or modified legislation.

Current California law and regulations are clearly insufficient to prevent massive fraud. The largest case so far involved the A3 Charter Schools in San Diego. The San Diego County District Attorney filed an 235 page indictment \parencite{SDDA2019} alleging a \$400M scheme to defraud the State of California. The two principle defendents pleaded guity \parencite{Taketa2021}.
Seventeen years earlier, the California State Auditor found that not only did authorizers and the California Department of Education fail to meet the student outcomes their charter required, but fiscal oversight was insufficient \parencite{CAStateAuditor2002}. In 2021, the Network for Public Education issued a report on how charter schools across the United States profit from lax oversight and regulations \parencite{Burris.Cimarusti2021}. Essentially, CMOs ``sweep'' all of the revenues of a charter school chain in return for administration, management, and marketing services. These CMOs may be for-profit corporations in other states. In 2016, Kamala Harris, then the California Attorney General, announced a settlement with K12 of \$168.5M because misleading advertising and misreported attendance numbers \parencite{Agpressoffice2016}.

One kind of fraud that is extremely difficult to monitor, as Justice Clarence Thomas has shown \parencite{Murphy.Mierjeski2023}, is that of gifts which do not involve the exchange of anything tangible, such as luxury vacations, private jet travel, and VIP passes to sporting events. These illegal gratuities leave no financial traces and it is likely establishing that a \textit{quid pro quo} exists would be difficult.

Some activities that are actually conflicts of interests can be masked so they appear as perfectly legal and normal and are yet another opportunity for profit. For example piloting edtech software (Dreambox, Clever, Zeal Learning) is an activity that many public, private, and charter schools do, and this (in theory) might improve the educational outcomes of students. But edtech companies also benefit. They get to have their products tested for free when charter schools pilot their software, and as a bonus, they can sell the data they obtain. Further, having a solid product increases the value of the edtech company if and when it is most likely sold. For example, the founder of two EdTech companies (John Danner) was also the founder of Rocketship, so there exists the possible of a conflict of interest\footnote{California conflict of interest law is complex and is beyond the scope of this dissertation \parencite{Chaney.etal2010}}.

With billions of dollars in funding every year in California alone, with accountability that is significantly less comprehensive than that of public schools, it is not surprising that fraud occurs in California's charter schools. Despite this, there is no indication that Rocketship or its principals engaged in fraudulent activities. However, as noted below, unaccounted for expenditures nonetheless leave open the possibility of private gain. 
\index{public policy issues!fraud|(}

\subsection{Real Estate Conversion}%
\label{sec:real-estate-conv}\indent%

\index{public policy issues!real estate conversion|(}
In the Public Interest, a national research and public policy organization, said:
\begin{quotation}\noindent
  Due to a loophole in [California] law, some private groups have used this public money to buy private property. While charter schools constructed with general obligation bonds cannot be sold or used for anything other than the authorized school, schools constructed with tax-exempt conduit bonds become the private property of the charter operator. Even if the charter is revoked, neither the state nor a local school district can take control of this property. Additionally, schools constructed with private funding subsidized by New Market Tax Credits or acquired with private funds but whose mortgage payments are reimbursed through the Charter Facilities Grant Program (known as “SB740”) are typically owned without restriction. In the event that such schools close down, their owners may be free to turn the buildings into condominiums or retail space, or sell them at a profit. In such cases, neither the school district nor any other public body is entitled to recoup the public dollars that have gone toward creating the facility. \parencite[6]{ITPI2018}
\end{quotation}

However, this is likely no longer correct because a plain reading of current law doesn't allow non-profits to benefit private individuals.\footnote{Here are a few excerpts from IRS regulations and California law.
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The IRS says this about 501(c)(3) organizations under the heading "Exemption Requirements":
    \begin{quote}\noindent
      To be tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, an organization must be organized and operated exclusively for exempt purposes set forth in section 501(c)(3), and none of its earnings may inure to any private shareholder or individual.
      \ldots\\
      The organization must not be organized or operated for the benefit of private interests, and no part of a section 501(c)(3) organization's net earnings may inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.
    \end{quote}
    \item The California Attorney General says in \textit{Attorney General's Guide for Charities} (2021):
    \begin{quote}
      Under California law, a public beneﬁt corporation must be formed for public or charitable purposes and may not be organized for the private gain of any person. A public beneﬁt corporation cannot distribute proﬁts, gains, or dividends to any person. (p.3)
    \end{quote}
    and
    \begin{quote}
      Although public beneﬁt corporations may qualify for important beneﬁts, including exemption from income tax, they are subject to important legal restrictions. One critical restriction is that the assets of a public beneﬁt corporation are considered irrevocably dedicated to charitable purposes, and cannot be distributed for private gain. (p.7)
    \end{quote}
    Finally, the AG says on p.14,
    \begin{quote}
      In addition, the founding document must require the organization to expressly dedicate its assets to exempt purposes in the event of dissolution.
    \end{quote}
    \item California Code, §§ 5130, 5237, 5410. Section 5410 says "No corporation shall make any distribution."
  \end{itemize}}
Consequently, income and assets, during the lifetime of the non-profit, or at dissolution, can only be transferred to other non-profits, and at dissolution, a 20-day prior notice must be given to the California Attorney General. The prohibition of private gain and the requirement to notify the CA Attorney General rule out Rocketship converting its properties to condominiums or retail space.

However, it is the case that lease payments under SB740 do continue even after any debt used to purchase real estate or to improve a property has been paid off. This is an income stream that provides no benefit to Rocketship's children because it merely increases the value of Rocketship itself without funding any academic programs.
\index{public policy issues!real estate conversion|)}

\section{Changes to Public Policy}%
\label{sec:chang-publ-policy}\indent

It is clear that public policy for the entire charter school sector needs to be updated with new or amended law and regulations to counter the innovation that people have shown in creating mechanisms to make money even when they should not. Only a few of these public policy changes are due to Rocketship and how it operates; the majority are due to other charter schools and charter school chains. If one believes that best disinfectant is sunshine, then the following changes which increase transparency should be considered:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Eliminate ``sweeps''
  \item Hold charter schools and charter school authorizers accountable
  \item Require a board to have at least one unaffiliated member
  \item Require auditors to express an opinion on the effectiveness internal controls.
\end{itemize}
These recommendations, elaborated on below, are similar to the policy recommendations of \textcite[44–46]{Baker.Miron2015}.\index{public policy!changes to}

\subsection{Eliminate Sweeps}%
\label{sec:eliminate-sweeps}\indent

\index{sweeps|(}
Sweeps are when all revenue is ``swept'' into a non-profit charter management organization (CMO) or a for-profit educational management organization (EMO). These management organizations are then responsible for all of the school's finances. Sweeps into EMOs are ripe for abuse because their operations are opaque, invisible to the public whose taxes fund charter schools. If one believes that publicly funded organizations should be answerable to their funders, taxpayers, then the finances of publicly funded organizations should be publicly visible, completely and comprehensively so. In addition, annual public audits of EMOs should be conducted by an independent auditor in exactly the same way that non-profit CMOs and public school are audited.
\index{sweeps|)}

\subsection{Hold Charter Schools To Their Charter}%
\label{sec:hold-charter-schools}\indent

\index{charter schools!accountability|(}
Charter schools exist because the state has granted them a charter to operate based on a petition submitted to an authorizer. The charter lays out the purpose and goals of the charter school and the ways that those goals will be met. In the last three years, the California Department of Education  recorded just 6 out of 57 closures (≈10\%) that were not voluntary. In 2022-23, there were ``more than 1,300 charter schools''\footnote{``Charter School Closures'' \url{https://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/ch/cefcharterschools.asp}} in California, so less than one-half of 1 percent of charter schools closed involuntarily. What seems highly improbable is that 1294 charter schools were substantially meeting their charter obligations. The research on charter student outcomes simply does not support that improbability. What is much more likely is that authorizers are simply not holding the charter schools accountable.

As previously noted, in 2021-22, just a few Santa Clara County authorized Rocketship charter schools did better than the state average on the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC) English Language Arts (ELA) tests that are part of the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CASPP) and none did better than the average for all Santa Clara County schools. The results for Mathematics (Math) are better, but still not stellar.\footnote{Standardized tests reveal remarkably little about how well a child is doing in school. For example, totally absent from measurement are 4 of the 6 C's of 21\textsuperscript{st}  century learning \parencite{Hirsh-Pasek.etal2020}: collaboration, communication, creative innovation, and confidence. Giving standardized tests the benefit of the doubt, one might claim that content and critical thinking are measured. Of course the 6 C's are just one way of viewing a child's education. Many alternatives ways of measuring non-academic outcomes exist, none of which are used by standardized tests.}

If charter schools are doing poorly compared to public schools in their districts, then they are not fulfilling a key premise of why they were created in the first place: They were granted exemption from onerous [sic] laws and regulations in return for better performance than public schools. Laws and regulation should be changed to make clear what happens if a charter school performs poorly over a number of years, and authorizers should have clearly spelled out responsibilities. At stake is not only the education of children, but millions if not billions of dollars annually in subsidies, grants, and loans.
\index{charter schools!accountability|)}

\subsection{Unaffiliated Board Member}\indent%
\label{sec:unaff-board-memb}\indent%

\index{unaffiliated board member|(}
School boards consider both high level strategy and tactical minutia. They are responsible for every aspect of starting and running of a charter school, but currently there is no requirement that charter school boards contain an unaffiliated member. (Unaffiliated in this contexts means that they have no connection or relationship with the charter school, board members, staff, i.e.\ their relationship is at arms length. Parents of children who attend the charter school would not be unaffiliated under this definition.) If visibility and transparency is a goal, having an unaffiliated board member is necessary because board meetings, especially closed sessions, are where decisions are made and the rationale for those decisions are articulated. Thus the law should require at least one unaffiliated board member.

Two possible ways of accomplishing this would be for the board of the public school district in which the charter is located to appoint a voting member or that one or more charter board members be elected by the voters of the public school district. Both of these alternatives would break up the self-perpetuating nature of charter school boards and would return control to the taxpayers who fund charter schools.
\index{unaffiliated board member|(}

\subsection{Effective Internal Controls}%
\label{sec:effect-intern-contr}\indent%

\index{charter schools!financial controls!effectiveness of|(}
It appears that routinely, independent auditors include in every audit report a statement similar to the following:
\begin{quotation}\noindent
  In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards, we [\ldots]
  [o]btain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but \textit{not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of RSEA’s internal control}. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. [Emphasis added]
\end{quotation}
This is curious because auditors are uniquely positioned to express an opinion on the effectiveness of internal controls. They have seen many examples, good, less good, and bad. If auditors do not evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls, who would be in a position to perform such an evaluation, fairly and comprehensively? The law should be extended to require auditors to express an opinion on the effectiveness of internal controls whenever they perform an annual audit of charter schools.\footnote{Requiring an opinion on the effectiveness of internal controls would be a be a significant change to accounting practice and would increase the cost of audit. But, on the benefit side, it would certainly increase transparency of charter school finances and would reduce the opportunity for fraud.}
\index{charter schools|financial controls!effectiveness of|)}

\section{Areas for Future Research}%
\label{sec:areas-future-rese}\indent%
This dissertation has discovered the need for future research. Some areas are Rocketship-specific; others are applicable to charter schools in general. Each of the surveys examined in \prettyref{sec:charter-surveys} starting on p.~\pageref{sec:charter-serveys} have recommendations for future research. In addition to those recommendations, this dissertation considers that research is needed in at least six areas.

\index{Rocketship!travel expenses|(}
The first area is Rocketship-specific. Rocketship recorded \$7.5M spent on travel in the four years of 2019–2022 and \$2.6M in 2022 alone. These are significant sums, so a future investigation should ask for details to substantiate the propriety of those expenditures. Details like who traveled, what class did they travel in, where did the go and where did they come from, and was the travel justified. Since these travel expenditures appeared in an annual financial statement, the investigation might ask what object codes went into each of the categories listed in \prettyref{tab:consolidated_functional_expenses} on p.\pageref{tab:consolidated_functional_expenses}.
\index{Rocketship!travel expenses|)}

\index{charter schools!fiscal monitoring|(}
The second area which needs further research has to do with oversight. As far back as 2002, the California State Auditor found that
\begin{textquote}[\parencite{CAStateAuditor2002}][.]{Chartering entities lacked policies and procedures for fiscal monitoring and have not adequately monitored their charter schools}
\end{textquote}
In other words, internal and external controls are lacking, but which specific controls and to what entities should the controls extend to need to be examined. For example, some charter schools have significantly inflated their enrollment \parencite{Taketa2021} but enrollment is just not monitored.
\index{charter schools!fiscal monitoring|(}\index{charter schools!dispossal of assets|(}

Another area which needs examination is a study of what happens to a charter's assets when a charter dissolves is needed because, although the law says that non-profits cannot benefit individuals, and non-profits must notify the Attorney General at dissolution, there is no effective monitoring nor is any enforcement mechanism. The result is that we really have no idea of what happened to the assets of the hundreds of charter schools which have closed since 1992.
\index{charter schools!disposal of assets|(}

\index{charter schools!net benefit of|(}
A fourth area for future research is calculating the net benefit of charter schools. Many studies have been made that examine the academic performance of charter schools vs public schools, and some studies have been made which quantify some of the costs to public schools when a charter school opens, but I am not aware of any study that incorporates \textit{all} of the costs and benefits of charter schools, even for a single school district, much less for an entire state or for all of the United States.

For example, one could ask how many grade 9-12 charter schools offer classes which allow graduates to apply to California's state universities. These are classes that meet the A-G requirements that are necessary to apply to California state universities. In particular,
\begin{textquote}[\parencite{Gallegos.Willis}] ``84\% of schools that do not offer a full range of A-G courses are charter schools''. Students in those schools are denied a benefit that is overwhelmingly available to public school students.  
\end{textquote}

Finally, a sixth area that has not been adequately explored is the large Excel spreadsheet that Rocketship used for forecasting and planning in 2009 which contains 26 separate sheets. (\url{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e5j8nn2Ofg6l5BlOaPi_qcByGH_OAt232RrvTkoJy2Q}). Some of its sheets forecast out to 2040, so it is clear that Rocketship is playing the long game. Understanding what Rocketship is thinking of doing would be revealed by a deep dive into this spreadsheet.

The conclusion this dissertation reaches is that, while no evidence of illegal activities related to providing financial benefit to private individuals exists, the structure of the Rocketship does appear to be designed benefit other non-profit corporations, in particular charter schools in states other than California. If this is the case, then Californian taxpayers are effectively subsidizing charter schools in other states, a use of Californian tax dollars that I expect Californians would overwhelmingly reject.

Given the history of fraud in charter schools, the amount of money which is sent to charter schools annually, and the lack of substantive financial controls and oversight, it would indeed be surprising if charter schools in California, and Rocketship in particular, were not engaged in some form of fraud. Further, the differences in finances and especially accountability between public schools and charter schools also admit the possibility for fraud in charter schools, a situation which is much less likely with the public school system because of their much greater transparency. It is difficult to prove that fraud has occurred, but it is even more difficult to prove that fraud has not occurred.
